It appears there was an error in retrieving the momentum indicator exclusively for SPY, possibly due to a technical limitation. However, based on the stock price data gathered from 2025-06-18 to 2025-07-18, we can gain insights into the momentum indirectly by examining price trends.

Over this period, SPY has shown a general upward price movement:
- Starting price on 2025-06-18: \$595.68
- Ending price on 2025-07-17: \$628.04

This represents a price increase, demonstrating a positive momentum in terms of price movement. Additionally, the volume traded during this period has been fluctuating, with no significant single event causing a drastic change.

Based on previous discussions emphasizing diversification, high P/E ratios, and low dividend yields, combined with a decent positive short-term momentum, the current movement upwards could be precarious if external economic conditions change unfavorably.

**Recommendation**
In light of the analysis, the strategic action would be to capitalize on the current upside to mitigate risk without exposure during potential downturns:
